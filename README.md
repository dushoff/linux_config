# linux_config

Files I maintain for my linux setup

rstudio
=======
* Started because of rstudio config -- but can't find good info!
* There is a big hidden folder: ~/.rstudio-desktop
	* Managing now using ~/Dropbox/rstudio – but not very much
	* Got pissed at rstudio right after I decided I finally liked it.

installation
